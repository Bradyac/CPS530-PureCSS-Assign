CPS530 - Term Project

Subject: Presentation and Website tutorial of a web application framework, content management framework, or content management system.

Teams: Minimum 4 students, maximum 6 students

Pick a framework or CMS of your choice (list below - one framework/CMS per team - will be on a first claimed basis). You create a website that presents the framework/CMS in a concise fashion as a tutorial.

Your website shall have 6 pages, all done using the framework/CMS of your choice. Following are the requirements for each of the six pages.

Page 1. A summary snapshot presentation of the Framework/CMS: Popularity, strengths, weaknesses, which developers mostly use it and for what kind of websites. Specify if it is backend, or frontend, or both. That page must be publicly available for your classmates to study for the final exam and will be considered required readings for all. A copy of it (may even be a pdf snapshot) can be hosted on a different host if your original page is not permanently and/or globally accessible.

Page 2. A tutorial showing in short simple steps how to install the framework/CMS on your chosen platform. The chosen platform can be the Ryerson server (you may have to ask support from the sys admins for specific installations), outside commercial hosting (can be shared hosting or a VPS like Digital Ocean), or to set your own server on your own machine (must have permanant connection!).

Page 3. A short tutorial showing how to create a great looking page with text, images, and styles using your chosen Framework/CMS. The subject of your page is entirely yours.

Page 4. The actual page that is the result of step #3.

Page 5. The conclusion. Rate your experience with the framework/CMS that you chose. Did it perform to your expectations? Was it difficult to install or configure? Was it easy the create the page with it? Was the learning curve steep compared with regular HTML/CSS? Would you have done things differently in retrospect? Did you regret your choice of framework/CMS?

Page 6. A credits page. Identify the team members (with pictures if possible) and mention the different members responsibilities. Also mention references here if non original material was used.

You will be also required to present your work on one of 6 dates: Nov 14, Nov 15, Nov 21, Nov 22, Nov 28, Nov 29. You will present the pages 1, 3, 4 , 5, and 6 of your website as a tutorial to your classmates and talk of your experience. You may decide to present as a team or delegate one teammate as a presenter. Your presentation must not exceed 8 minutes. Important: If you go overtime you will lose points as our time is very limited and it will be detrimental to the teams presenting after you. So plan and rehearse your presentation accordingly.

Submission of the project is do be done on the D2L/Brightspace system. You will need to submit two URLs:
[1] The URL to the main entry point of your project site.
[2] The URL of the public page (page 1) that will be published for your classmates to visit.
