					<td>Did the framework perform to your expectations?</td>
					<td>As mentioned before Pure.CSS offers a set of small, responsive CSS modules.
						Modules for forms, tables, buttons, grids and menus mainly. It performed
						exactly as expected. It simply provides predefined style attributes that are
						easy to implement, and build upon.</td>
				</tr>

				<tr>
					<td>2</td>
					<td>Was it difficult to install or configure?</td>
					<td>Implementing Pure.CSS into a project is rather simple. It consists
						of a few CSS file(s) that you can include as you normally would within the
						(head) of an HTML document. After that you can start using it. Similar to 
						bootstrap but very lightweight.</td>
				</tr>

				<tr class="pure-table-odd">
					<td>3</td>
					<td>Was it easy the create the page with it?</td>
					<td>Creating a page with Pure.CSS was alike to creating any other HTML/CSS
						webpage. Most of the modules included very simple style changes to common
						HTML elements. Some of the modules like the grid system took some time to
						understand. Overall it felt fairly simple and straight forward.</td>
				</tr>

				<tr>
					<td>4</td>
					<td>Was the learning curve steep compared with regular HTML/CSS?</td>
					<td>Working with the Pure.CSS framework was alike to just working with
						HTML/CSS. As mentioned above, the framework basically adds some
						predefined style attributes that can be used along with your own
						HTML/CSS. The most difficult part was learning and understanding the
						grid system. The only resources that could be found were on the frameworks
						webpage. It was difficult to find good information elsewhere. The information
						provided on the frameworks page sufficed and overall the learning curve is not
						steep.</td>
				</tr>

				<tr class="pure-table-odd">
					<td>5</td>
					<td>Would you have done things differently in retrospect?</td>
					<td>Throughout the project we learned and built our webpage using everything the
						frameworks webpage had to offer. It was rather easy to cover everything Pure
						has to offer.</td>
				</tr>

				<tr>
					<td>6</td>
					<td>Did you regret your choice of framework/CMS?</td>
					<td>Overall the framework was easy enough to impement and work with. It isn't a large
						framework at all. It would have been interesting to work with a more popular tool
						that had more capability. Nevertheless, it was a useful tool for building a quick
						website that looked better than no styling at all. We have no regret in choosing
						to work with Pure.CSS.</td>
